# purchase_offer

This level concerns a peer to peer NFT marketplace with an advanced feature —
purchase offers. A buyer is able to create a purchase offer where she puts the
ADA amount she offers in exchange for an asset she wants to purchase. She
specifies the asset in the datum. Moreover, she can choose to ask for any NFT
from a particular collection.

During the setup, a unique precious NFT is minted and put into your wallet. In
the same transaction, multiple purchase offers are created. Since you own an NFT
somebody is asking for in their purchase offers, you can sell it to them and
unlock their ADA. Can you unlock more than they offer?

## On-chain code

There is a single validator and a single minting policy that are involved in
this task:

- `nft`: It is a simple minting policy by which your unique precious NFT is
  minted. It is the same policy used in the [sell_nft](../01_sell_nft/) task.

- `purchase_offer`: Purchase offer validator. The amount of ADA locked in
  purchase offer UTxOs is fully unlocked if the desired NFT is sold in the
  transaction. The sold NFT is checked against the configuration in the datum.
  The datum carries the desired policy id and an optional token name of the
  asset. If no token name is set, any NFT from the collection is accepted. The
  redeemer specifies the specific asset that is being sold.

## Off-chain code

As usual, create a copy of the `player_template.ts` named `player.ts` that you
can run with the `deno run --allow-net --allow-read ./scripts/run.ts` command.
The code that requires modification lies in this file in the appropriate
section.

As always, we recommend examining the rest of the off-chain code, especially the
`setup()` function in [task.ts](./scripts/task.ts) which can aid in
understanding the setup of this level and provide useful examples of how to
interact with the validators.
