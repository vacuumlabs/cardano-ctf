# multisig_treasury_v3

**Spoiler alert:** This level is a direct continuation of
[Level 07: Multisig Treasury v2](../07_multisig_treasury_v2/) and contains
spoilers for its solution. We recommend solving this level only after
successfully completing Level 07.

This level again uses a simple multi-signature treasury. The treasury holds a
certain amount of ADA and is owned by a group of addresses. To release any
portion of the funds, all its owners must agree. To express their will, they
sign a Multisig UTxO that specifies the amount to be released and the
destination address – where the funds should be released. Most importantly, it
accumulates signatures as they can sign it across multiple transactions.

The statement is the same as in the previous Multisig Treasury level. A treasury
UTxO is created, locking 10 ADA for two owners – yourself and an another owner.
To withdraw the funds, you must provide the treasury validator with a multisig
UTxO signed by both owners. However, you lack the private key for the second
address and can not contact him, making it seemingly impossible to obtain his
signature.

## Changes

**The multisig UTxO validator has been modified** to mitigate a specific attack
vector that could be exploited in Level 07.

⚠️ However, it's important to note that the remaining attack vector was also
present in the Level 07's validator. If you successfully exploited it in the
previous level, congratulations! You can find out whether that's the case by
trying to run your `player.ts` from the Level 07 in this task. If it passes this
level, we encourage you to return to Level 07 and try to solve it differently
**without** reading the codebase of this level.

The on-chain code in this level is the same as in the previous level except for
the vulnerability from the Level 07 that is fixed. The off-chain code of this
task is exactly the same as before. You can refer to their high-level
descriptions
[in the previous README](../07_multisig_treasury_v2/README.md#on-chain-code).
