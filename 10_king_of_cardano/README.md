# king_of_cardano

The King of Cardano is a competition, where the winner gets the opportunity to
mint his own customized King of Cardano NFT! The rules of the competition are
simple — you have to spend more money than your predecessor to overthrow him as
a king. The overthrown king gets all his money back. Whoever is the king once
the competition is over is the real king and can mint his NFT.

## On-chain code

There is a single validator and two minting policies that are involved in this
task:

- `king_nft`: The price for the winner. The actual King of Cardano NFT. It can
  be minted only once and by the current king once the competition is over.

- `king_of_cardano`: The main contract. It allows for three actions:
  - **OverthrowKing**: Enables you to overthrow the current king and become one.
  - **CloseCompetition**: The admin uses it to end the competition.
  - **MintKingNFT**: Once the competition is closed, the final king can use it
    to mint the NFT.

- `unique_nft`: This is a similar policy used in other tasks as well, for the
  purpose of minting a unique NFT that can not be minted again. It is modified
  to allow burning of the token. In this task, it is used in the bootstrapping
  process: The person that initializes the competition first mints the unique
  NFT using this policy, then compiles all the other scripts using this NFT as a
  parameter and puts the NFT itself into the newly created `king_of_cardano`
  UTxO. In a way, it also serves as a validity token for that UTxO, uniquely
  identifying the correct competition UTxO.

## Off-chain code

As usual, create a copy of the `player_template.ts` named `player.ts` that you
can run with the `deno run --allow-net --allow-read ./scripts/run.ts` command.

The testing process in this task is as follows:

1. We try to overthrow the current king. You pay for the fees, so you should
   leave enough ADA in your wallet so that the transaction is feasible. We check
   that you do. The attempt should fail.
2. The admin closes the competition. This is a simplification to simulate an
   accelerated passage of time. Under normal circumstances, no administrative
   role would be required. This adjustment is made purely for simplification
   purposes.
3. We try to claim the King of Cardano NFT on your behalf.

Your aim is to become a king who can not be overthrown and who ultimately claims
a customized King of Cardano NFT. Don't forget to pick a cool nickname :).

## Notes

This task points to a number of problems and is language specific. There are at
least two distinct attack vectors with the stack we chose. The upcoming blogpost
discussing this will discuss three problems this points to. Ultimately, there is
at least one issue that is an issue in all the common languages — Plutus,
Plutarch, Aiken. Try to find it. Good luck and have fun!
