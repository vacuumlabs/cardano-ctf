# tipjar

We created a Tip Jar where you can send us tips with nice messages attached! You
can use it to show how much you appreciate the CTF. The Jar works very simply –
anyone can put (testnet) ADA into it and write a new message into the datum. We
enforce a minimum tip to prevent attackers from increasing contention of the Tip
Jar by adding too little ADA. The owner can empty the Tip Jar anytime.

Your goal in this task is different from the previous tasks – you want to just
**damage** the owner and **forbid other people from tipping** into the Jar. Such
attacks are called Denial Of Service (DoS). The tests in this task will try to
add one more tip, and if they fail, you win!

## Warnings

Be careful, some solutions might pass in the emulator but not on the testnet.
Also, because of the nature of this task, there are possibly more paths to the
solution. Please drop us a comment if you think you found a unique solution!
