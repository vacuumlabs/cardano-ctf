# sell_nft

In this task, we will explore a simple peer to peer NFT marketplace. The
validator is a simple contract where the seller locks an NFT. The datum contains
the address of the seller and the price of the NFT he wants to sell for. Anyone
can then buy this NFT by spending the UTxO in a transaction given he sends the
price of the NFT to the seller.

During the setup, two UTxOs are created at that script address. They both
contain a different NTF, belong to the same owner and have different price. Your
goal is to acquire both of them without spending too much ADA.

## On-chain code

The important validator here is the [nft_sell.ak](./validators/nft_sell.ak).
That is the smart contract that governs the selling and buying of the NFTs.

The other two files are helpers that you do not need to use, but feel free to
explore:

- [locked.ak](./validators/locked.ak) — A validator where anything gets locked.
  Forever. The address of this validator is used as the seller of the NFTs.
- [nft.ak](./validators/nft.ak) — The minting policy of the NFTs. It checks that
  given UTxOs are spent, thus guaranteeing that the minted NFTs are not reminted
  in future transactions.

## Off-chain code

You only have to make changes in the `player.ts` file. Similar to the previous
level, you can create it by copying the
[player_template.ts](./scripts/player_template.ts). Inside the file, the
relevant parts are clearly commented, starting with
`================ YOUR CODE STARTS HERE` and ending with
`================ YOUR CODE ENDS HERE`.

You should interact with the deployed smart contracts in between the two
comments. The code that is already there buys a single NFT from the seller — it
doesn't pass all the tests because it buys only one of the two required NFTs.
Try to pass all the tests by modifying it.

As before, you can run the code and tests with:
`deno run --allow-net --allow-read ./scripts/run.ts`
