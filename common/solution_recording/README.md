# Solution recording

To monitor all CTF solutions, we've devised this simple smart contract. Once a
task is successfully completed on the testnet, an additional transaction is
initiated, creating a UTxO at its address. This UTxO logs a successful solution,
comprising the task ID, the solution timestamp, and the solver's address.

Note that these details are already publicly accessible on the testnet as part
of the successful submission. Thus, no private information is disclosed at any
moment. This approach, however, lets us track the solutions more easily and even
you can display them using the `scoreboard.ts` script.

To ensure a fixed smart contract address, we've embedded the address into the
code using the `SOLUTION_RECORD_ADDRESS` variable. The smart contract is
parametrized so its address won't clash with a simple "always yields false"
validator that could be used by other developers as well.
