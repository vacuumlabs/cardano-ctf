# tipjar_v2

**Spoiler alert: Do not attempt this level before solving level 04 -
[tipjar](../04_tipjar/). This task builds on top of it and reveals the idea of
the vulnerability.**

The code and the goal of this level are both similar to the
[tipjar](../04_tipjar/). The validator is updated to mitigate two attack vectors
present in the previous version. However, we believe that it is still possible
to perform a DoS attack on the Tip Jar and prevent other people from tipping.
Can you find and demonstrate the vulnerability?

## Warnings

Some solutions might pass in the emulator but not on the testnet. Always verify
your solution on the testnet as well.

If your solution from the [tipjar](../04_tipjar/) passes here as well, try to go
back and find a different attack vector for the first version of the tipjar.
